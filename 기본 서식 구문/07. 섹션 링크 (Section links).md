## 섹션 링크 (Section links)

제목이 있는 모든 섹션에 직접 연결할 수 있습니다. 렌더링된 파일에서 자동으로 생성된 앵커를 보려면 섹션 제목 위로 마우스를 가져가 ![alt text](<첨부-섹션 링크. link.jpg>) 아이콘을 표시하고 아이콘을 클릭하여 브라우저에 앵커를 표시합니다.

You can link directly to any section that has a heading. To view the automatically generated anchor in a rendered file, hover over the section heading to expose the {% octicon "link" aria-label="the link" %} icon and click the icon to display the anchor in your browser.

If you need to determine the anchor for a heading in a file you are editing, you can use the following basic rules:

* Letters are converted to lower-case.
* Spaces are replaced by hyphens (`-`). Any other whitespace or punctuation characters are removed.
* Leading and trailing whitespace are removed.
* Markup formatting is removed, leaving only the contents (for example, `_italics_` becomes `italics`).
* If the automatically generated anchor for a heading is identical to an earlier anchor in the same document, a unique identifier is generated by appending a hyphen and an auto-incrementing integer.

For more detailed information on the requirements of URI fragments, see [RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax, Section 3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.5).

The code block below demonstrates the basic rules used to generate anchors from headings in rendered content.

```markdown
# Example headings

## Sample Section

## This'll be a _Helpful_ Section About the Greek Letter Θ!
A heading containing characters not allowed in fragments, UTF-8 characters, two consecutive spaces between the first and second words, and formatting.

## This heading is not unique in the file

TEXT 1

## This heading is not unique in the file

TEXT 2

# Links to the example headings above

Link to the sample section: [Link Text](#sample-section).

Link to the helpful section: [Link Text](#thisll-be-a-helpful-section-about-the-greek-letter-Θ).

Link to the first non-unique section: [Link Text](#this-heading-is-not-unique-in-the-file).

Link to the second non-unique section: [Link Text](#this-heading-is-not-unique-in-the-file-1).
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you edit a heading, or if you change the order of headings with "identical" anchors, you will also need to update any links to those headings as the anchors will change.
